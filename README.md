# Field-Dependence-Independence-game
In the context of my thesis, I hade to create a web puzzle game. 108 participants played it and whose data I used to analyze and predict 
their Field Dependence-Independence Group

## Thesis Abstract

People are approaching every information differently and they also differ in their 
individual cognitive skills. There are is a lot of research on cognitive styles, trying to 
target and explain these differences and to separate participants in groups based on the 
way they process information. This particular research deals with the Field
Dependence-Independence (FD-I) cognitive style, that separates people in two groups 
depending on how they approach knowledge retrieval and how they extract conclusions 
and process information from a learning process. The purpose of the current thesis is to 
create an interactive web game capable of predicting the cognitive style of users in runtime without human intervention. To this end, many users played this game and they 
also completed a test that classifies them as FD or FI. This web game challenges the 
user to adapt in alternation of various shapes and colors combinations aiming to check 
adaptability and observation on them. It also requires from users to have good shortterm memory and good perception of the differences of these shapes. The game 
collected user interaction data, which were then used in statistical analysis and in 
machine learning. Statistical analysis explored whether there is any significant 
difference in any attribute of data between the two groups. It was found that FI
participants had a slightly better performance than FD participants and that they chose 
more often to play the game with increased difficulty. Next, machine learning 
algorithms were used to train a model that can predict the userâ€™s cognitive style after 
playing the web game. Five different algorithms with various alternation of their 
parameters were tested and the best accuracy that predicts the group of the user is 83%.

#### From this thesis, we published a paper in PCI (end of November 2021), which is focused on the game. The PDF of the paper is also uploaded. The conference is recent, 
#### so the DOI is not ready yet.
